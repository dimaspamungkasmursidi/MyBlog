## Introduction

Hello, I'm Dimas Pamungkas MursidiðŸ‘‹, a Web Developer from Bekasi, Indonesia. I enjoy building websites using React JS, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion for animations. Currently, I work at FYP Media as an Intern in the Frontend Web division, where our team is developing a news portal website using Laravel 10.

## Early Days in IT

I didn't have any prior IT background. I graduated from High School with a focus on Light Vehicle Engineering, where I learned about car mechanics and electrical systems. My journey into IT began when I was deciding on further education. Uncertain about where to study and what program to choose, I researched career paths on Google. I came across articles highlighting the popularity and high salaries in IT jobs at the time. This led me to enroll in the Computer Science Faculty, majoring in Informatics at a university in Bekasi.

During the first four semesters, I struggled without a clear focus until I joined the Internship and Certified Independent Study Program (MSIB) in Web Development during the fifth and sixth semesters. Initially, coding was challenging, but over time, I became proficient. I believe MSIB is a beneficial government program for students, as it provided me with the opportunity to code and discover my identity as a web developer.

## Message I Want to Convey

For those starting out in IT, I encourage diligent learning without excessive pressure, as it can lead to burnout and loss of interest.

Thank you for reading my journey. I hope it's informative and inspiring!
